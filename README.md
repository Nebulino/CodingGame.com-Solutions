### Who am I?

First of all, I'm not a good computer scientist (Docet)...
But in this first year of University I've learned a lot!

```markdown
Right now in all of my study career I know, in a basic way:
# Python 3.X.X / 2.7
## Visual Basic (VB. Net)
### Basics of HTML, aspx

Other things I've tested in my life:
- Java (Android Development)
- JS (Some minigames created @ college, but I can't say I know it...)

```
